  abstract = {In order to test Dicke’s idea of a clock hidden inside the Sun and determine the initial phase of the solar cycle, the epochs of the extrema of the Wolf numbers observed over the past 400 years are examined. It is shown that extrema that obey the period P W equaled 11.07(4) years retain the initial phase, which cannot be explained in terms of local physics and concepts of the past century regarding the mechanism of the solar cycle based on the theory of a magnetic dynamo and the phenomenological model of the Babcock-Leighton cycle. It is suggested that the cycle has a cosmic (cosmological) origin. This is clearly indicated by the correlation of the cycle period with a holographic time-scale of the Universe, (a 0 R 3)1/4/c ≈ 11.0(4) years, where a 0 and R are the radii of the first Bohr orbit of a hydrogen atom and the observable Universe, respectively, and c is the speed of light. It is noted that there are other strict holographic relations that include a 0, R, P W , the wavelength of the microwave background radiation (with a temperature of 2.7 K), and a period of the global solar pulsations equal to 9600.6 s. The true physical nature of the governing mechanism for the 11-year cycle can perhaps only be understood based on modern concepts about the nonlocality of our world, which follows from Bell’s theorem, which is grounded on the achievements of quantum mechanics at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, as well as using a model of a holographic Universe free of c.},
